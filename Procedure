Step-by-Step Guide
1. Data Collection
Collect datasets from Kaggle that include features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region. These datasets will be used to train and test your machine learning model.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary and transform existing features to a suitable format for the model.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, typically using a 70-30 or 80-20 split.
3. Model Selection
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting health insurance premiums. Based on the provided research papers, several regression algorithms can be considered:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
ElasticNet Regression
Support Vector Regression
K Nearest Neighbor Regression
Neural Network Regression
4. Model Training and Evaluation
Train the selected models on the training dataset and evaluate their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), R-Squared (R²), Adjusted R-Squared (Adj. R²), and Explained Variance Score (EVS).

5. Model Deployment
Deploy the best-performing model in your healthcare aid application to predict insurance premiums based on user input parameters.

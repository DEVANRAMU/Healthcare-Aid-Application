Here's a brief write-up for the data preprocessing steps in your healthcare aid application:


Data Preprocessing Steps:

1. Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using the `pandas` library.
   
python code : 

   data = pd.read_csv('path_to_kaggle_dataset.csv')
  

2. Handling Missing Values and Outliers : Any missing values in the dataset are removed to ensure data integrity.
   
python code :

   data = data.dropna()
   
3. Feature Engineering : The categorical feature 'region' is converted into numerical codes to facilitate model training.

python code :

   data['region'] = data['region'].astype('category').cat.codes


4. Splitting the Data : The dataset is split into features (`X`) and target variable (`y`). The data is then divided into training and testing sets with a 70-30 split.
  
python code :

   X = data.drop('charges', axis=1)
   y = data['charges']
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
   

5. Standardizing Features : The features are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps in improving the performance of many machine learning algorithms.
   
python code :

   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
   X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
   
This preprocessing ensures the data is clean, well-structured, and ready for training the machine learning model.
